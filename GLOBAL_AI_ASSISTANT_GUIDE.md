- **"tomorrow"** or **"tmr"** - Next day
- **"today"** - Current day
- **"next Monday/Tuesday/etc."** - Next occurrence of that day
- **"this Monday/Tuesday/etc."** - This week's occurrence

### Specific Dates
- **"2024-01-15"** - ISO format
- **"15/01/2024"** - DD/MM/YYYY format

## Supported Time Formats

### 12-Hour Format

## How It Works

### 1. **Context Awareness**
The AI automatically detects which page you're on and adapts its responses accordingly:
- **Tasks page** ‚Üí Task creation assistance
- **Calendar page** ‚Üí Event creation assistance  
- **Settings page** ‚Üí Settings guidance

### 2. **Natural Language Processing**
The AI understands various ways to express the same thing:
```
"Meeting tomorrow at 2pm" = "Meeting with client tomorrow at 2:00 PM"
"Call next Monday 3pm" = "Phone call next Monday at 15:00"
"Review docs Friday 9-11" = "Review documents on Friday from 9:00 to 11:00"
```

### 3. **Smart Defaults**
When you don't specify certain details, the AI makes intelligent assumptions:
- **No end time** ‚Üí Adds 1 hour to start time
- **No date** ‚Üí Uses today or tomorrow based on context
- **No title** ‚Üí Creates title from description

### 4. **Form Integration**
After processing your request, the AI:
- Fills in the appropriate form fields
- Shows you what it understood
- Lets you review and modify before saving

## Tips for Best Results

### ‚úÖ **Be Specific**
```
Good: "Team meeting tomorrow at 10am for 2 hours"
Better: "Weekly team meeting tomorrow at 10am for 2 hours to discuss Q4 goals"
```

### ‚úÖ **Include Key Information**
- **What** you need to do
- **When** (date and time)
- **How long** it will take (optional)

### ‚úÖ **Use Natural Language**
```
Good: "Meeting with client tomorrow at 2pm"
Avoid: "Create task meeting client tomorrow 2pm"
```

### ‚úÖ **Be Clear About Duration**
```
Good: "Review documents for 2 hours on Friday"
Good: "Call supplier tomorrow at 3pm for 30 minutes"
```

```

### **Context Switching**
